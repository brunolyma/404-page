## Overview

- Where can I see your demo?

      You can see it in Vercel deploy and in my DevChallenges profile.

- What was your experience?

      It was my first time on the DevChallenges plataform and for an easy level challenge it was also a good way to practice quick styling of a simple page.

- What have you learned/improved?

      I tried to develop using semantic tags and mobile first concept, something 100% responsive with breakpoints for medium and large screens.
